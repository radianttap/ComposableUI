NSCookbook: iOS Programming Recipe 28: View Controller Containment & Transitioning (Aug 2013)

Main topics
- allows creation of lightweight VCs which encapsulate single task
- can mix and match controllers as you wish
- interoperability is achieved using delegate pattern
- UIKit handles all the heavy lifting
- with `showViewController:` API from iOS 8, removes the last remaining hard glue (no more `pushViewController:`)
- UIKit support for transitions from one view controller to another `transitionFromViewController:toViewController:duration:...`
